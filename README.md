General bug reporting for Xubuntu. While we'd prefer that you report bugs on Launchpad, you can use this repository to easily report a bug for Xubuntu.

## Reporting bugs on Launchpad

If you know the name of the affected package, you can easily report a bug with the `ubuntu-bug` command or through Launchpad. 

### Using ubuntu-bug

Simply use ubuntu-bug to capture relevant system information along with your bug report. This will help Xubuntu developers reproduce your issue. For example, reporting a bug for Firefox would look like:

```bash
ubuntu-bug firefox
```

### Direct reporting on Launchpad

It is also possible to directly report a bug through Launchpad. Simply go to `https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/PACKAGENAME/+filebug`, replacing `PACKAGENAME` by the package name you want to report the bug against. For example, reporting a bug for Firefox would look like:

```
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+filebug
```
